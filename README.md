# Phase 1 MICROSOFT MOVIE STUDIO ANALYSIS

Introduction

Microsoft is venturing into the world of original video content creation and aims to establish a new movie studio. The goal of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand what types of films are currently thriving at the box office. By analyzing ratings data from IMDb, we aim to provide actionable insights to guide Microsoft's new movie studio in making informed decisions regarding the types of films they should create.

Objectives
You will be able to:

1. Analyze data to identify trends in the box office performance of movies
2. Offer actionable insights and recommendations to guide Microsoft in their venture into the movie industry
3. Utilize various datasets to perform exploratory data analysis
4. Ensure that the data used for analysis is accurate, reliable, and well-structured
5. Combine relevant datasets to create a unified dataset that encompasses essential information about movies
6. Equip Microsoft with the necessary information to make informed decisions about their movie production endeavors, ultimately aiming for success in the film industry.

Datasets
We have selected four datasets to conduct a comprehensive analysis for Microsoft's new movie studio. Each dataset provides unique and valuable information that, when combined, will offer a holistic understanding of the factors influencing a movie's success at the box office.

tmdb.movies.csv: This dataset contains information about movies, including genre IDs, original language, popularity, release date, and voting details.

im.db: This database includes various tables such as movie basics, directors, known for, movie AKAs, movie ratings, persons, principals, and writers, providing extensive information about movies and related entities.

bom.movie_gross.csv: This dataset offers details about movie titles, studios, domestic gross, foreign gross, and release year.

tn.movie_budgets.csv: This dataset provides information about movie release dates, titles, production budgets, domestic gross, and worldwide gross.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We performed an in-depth analysis of the datasets to uncover valuable insights. This included visualizing distributions of popularity, vote average, and vote count, as well as exploring relationships between popularity and vote metrics.

Comparative Analysis
We conducted comparative analyses to evaluate the performance of different studios, genres, and release years. This information will be crucial in guiding Microsoft's new movie studio.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
We ensured that the data was clean and well-prepared for analysis. This involved handling missing values, addressing data errors, and quality assurance checks.

Merging Datasets
We merged various datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. This unified dataset includes essential information about movies, budgets, and box office performance.

Conclusion
Through this comprehensive analysis, we have gained valuable insights into the factors influencing a movie's success at the box office. This information will be instrumental in guiding Microsoft's new movie studio in making informed decisions about the types of films to produce.
